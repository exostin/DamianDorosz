<h1 align="center">About me</h1>

From an early age, I was surrounded by games and technology, always fascinated by the possibility of creating my own software. I am self-taught - I started by trial and error with very simple applications in C++, then automation of tasks in Python, and finally I turned to create games in Unity engine using C# language. I've worked on two game projects in an international team. My main goal is to grow in the game development industry.

#### About me

- 🎮 I've been a game developer and the team leader at [Expiry Date](https://github.com/exostin/ExpiryDate).
  - 🌿 Worked mainly on the turn-based battle system, but the game also consists of a city-building system!
  - 🏆 Expiry Date was created in a team of ten, as part of a nationwide game development championship among highschool students: ["Turniej Trójgamiczny"](https://www.t3g.pl/).
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working as a Junior .NET Developer, but I'm also interested in game development and I want to contribute to an open-source project one day :)

# Welcome :)
I've been curious about how things work basically since I could understand spoken language. Disassembling electronic toys, watching tech, engineering, science and biology TV shows.

At the age of 10, I was tinkering around with video editing software, modding games, fixing other people's PC issues, messing around with Linux (elementary OS), and trying to pick up C++.

I started learning programming seriously when I was 13 years old, when I picked up Python. When I was 16, I've created [my first Unity game](https://github.com/exostin/SuperCubeBoy3D). Got an apprenticeship and created [another game](https://github.com/exostin/ConsoleBattleshipsGame), where I've practiced OOP in C#. Then [two](https://github.com/sirjust/PawnsHaveSouls) in an international team, under the lead and mentoring of an experienced developer (currently a Microsoft Software Engineer), where I've also learned to freely use Git, along with it's conventions. Then I went to another apprenticeship and made [an another game :D](https://github.com/exostin/UnityBattleships).

At the age of 18, I participated in a national game development championship among high school students, in a team of ten, as a game developer and the team leader. We've created a city building [game](https://github.com/exostin/ExpiryDate) with turn-based combat system, set in a fantasy climatic calamity setting. We participated in workshops and mentoring sessions, where we were introduced to design patterns (such as state machine, memento, factory, command, observer), clean code, and SOLID principles by professional game developers from the Pyramid Games studio.

Soon after finishing that, I've picked up another apprenticeship, where I made my first ASP.NET Core MVC [web app](WatchList_DEMO.gif) for tracking watched movies and series. Not long after which, I got my first job as a Junior .NET Developer in a company providing tailored solutions, and SaaS targeted at e-commerce.

In the meantime, on the road to being a full-blown geek, I've learned and became attached to the vim key bindings, utilizing them wherever possible; gone down the OpSec rabbit hole (online security, privacy and anonymity); as well as into one on FOSS and philosophy surrounding it, picking up lots of knowledge along the way, and switching my main OS to GNU/Linux :)

I attended [Code Europe](https://www.codeeurope.pl/en/), the largest tech event in Poland, where I've got the opportunity to listen to highly experienced people teach interesting programming concepts. Thanks to which I've got some insight into concepts such as: CQRS (from the creator himself!), container orchestration, automated testing approaches, code architecture (event-driven, event mesh, service mesh), and more!

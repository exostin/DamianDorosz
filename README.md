From an early age, I was surrounded by games and technology, I was always fascinated by the possibility of creating my own software. I am self-taught, so I started by trial and error with very simple applications in C++, then automation of tasks in Python, and finally I turned to create games in Unity engine using C# language. This way I've already worked on three projects, two of them in an international team, communicating only using English.

#### About me

- 🌎 Worked on two game projects in an international team.
- 🎮 Have been a game developer and the team leader at [Expiry Date](https://github.com/exostin/ExpiryDate).
  - 🌿 Worked mainly on the turn-based battle system, but the game also consists of a city-building system!
  - 🏆 Expiry Date was created in a team of ten, as part of game development championship among highschool students in Poland: ["Turniej Trójgamiczny"](https://www.t3g.pl/).
- 👨‍💻 My main goal is to grow in the game development industry, and I'd love to contribute to some open-source projects!
